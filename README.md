# brisavion.github.io

## Main programming languages:

My main workhorse is Scala. That said, my dream is to be "fluent" (whatever that means) in at least four PL:

* Scala
* Swift
* Kotlin
* Rust

Having seen this list, you can probably guess which side of the static-vs-dynamic-types debate I come down on.

## but wait, there is more

Main 4 language aside, I also strive to be at least somewhat capable in the following (listed alphabetically, to avoid playing favorites):

* Crystal
* Elixir
* Haskell
* HTML, CSS (+ HTMX)
* Go
* Perl 5
* Raku / Perl 6
* Typescript

## Main programming languages:

My main workhorse is Scala, with which I have developed a sort of love-hate relationship over the years (with love consistently prevailing, I am happy to add). That said, this has not been an all-consuming or even a monogamous affair: my goal is to become "fluent" (whatever that means) in at least four PL and use them in those scenarios where they are most appropriate/advantageous:

* Scala
* Swift
* Kotlin
* Rust

Having seen this list, you can probably guess which side of the static-vs-dynamic-types debate I come down on. Sorry, DHH:
Ruby is not on the likely to ever get on my list.

Incidentally, this list of four covers practically all areas of interest to someone who insists on meddling
in all aspects of a startup's product lifecycle. With one awkward exception of web front-end. Which may prove to be
a temporary omission, after all, thanks to the rise of WASM.

## but wait, there is more

The main 4 language aside, I also strive to be at least minimally capable in all of the following (listed alphabetically, to avoid playing favorites):

* Crystal
* Elixir
* Haskell
* HTML, CSS (+ HTMX)
* Go
* Java
* Perl 5
* Raku / Perl 6
* Shell
* Typescript
